# python_finances
A collection of financial functions for use in a Python shell
The functions are arranged in classes based on their uses. There are duplicated formulas for simplicity of use and understanding.
Each function should have a simple description of what it is, the variables it takes, and an example word problem.

This project was used by me in my Finance classes as well as in my personal finances.
